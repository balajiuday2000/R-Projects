This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Objective : A simple app to interactively display histogram of 'nControls' in esoph dataset.

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
ui <- fluidPage( titlePanel("NControls Count"),
                 
                 sidebarPanel(
                   
                   sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                               label = "Number of bins : ",
                               min = 1,
                               max = 100,
                               value = 30)
                   
                 ),
                 
                 mainPanel(
                   
                   plotOutput(outputId = "histogram")
                 )
                 
)
```
```{r}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$histogram <- renderPlot({
    
    x <- esoph$ncontrols
    x <- na.omit(x)
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    hist(x, breaks = bins, xlab = "nControls", main = "Histogram of nControls")
    
  })
}
```
```{r}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
