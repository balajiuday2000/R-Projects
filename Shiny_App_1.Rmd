This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Objective : A simple app to experiment with obtaining input from user, processing the input and displaying the results.

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
```
```{r}
# Define UI
ui <- fluidPage(theme = shinytheme('yeti'),
                
                navbarPage(
                  theme = "yeti",
                  "Name Displayer",
                  
                  tabPanel("NavBar 1",
                    sidebarPanel(
                      tags$h3("Input :"),
                      textInput("txt1", " First Name :", ""),
                      textInput("txt2", "Last Name :", ""),
                    ),
                    
                    mainPanel(
                      h1("Output :"),
                      verbatimTextOutput("txtout"),
                    )
                  ),
                  
                  tabPanel("NavBar 2", "This page is left blank."),
                  tabPanel("NavBar 3", "This page is left blank.")
                )
)
```
```{r}
# Define Server
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$txtout <- renderText({ paste(input$txt1, input$txt2) })
}
```
```{r}
# Define Shiny object
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
